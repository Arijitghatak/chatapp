\# Java Socket Chat App – Idea



\## What this project is

A simple client–server chat application built using \*\*Java Sockets\*\* and \*\*multithreading\*\*.

The purpose is to understand how real-time communication works at a low level.



\## How it works (high level)

\- Server listens on a fixed port

\- Client connects using socket

\- Both sides can send and receive messages

\- Reading and writing run on separate threads



\## Key concepts used

\- ServerSocket \& Socket

\- BufferedReader \& PrintWriter

\- Blocking I/O

\- Multithreading with Runnable

\- Basic Swing UI (client side)



\## Scope

\- Single client

\- Text-based messaging

\- No database, no frameworks



\## Note

This file will be updated after final code is complete.
